# BASS:ON Website

I've ([@itisrazza]) made this website for our BASS:ON homepage.

I've taken care so it's maintainable as much as possible for the GitHub website. If something doesn't work, get in touch.

## Adding an Event

* Create a new event in `_events/%year%-%name%.md` copying [this template](_events/example-rave.md).
* Add a background graphic in [`static/banners/%year%-%name%.jpg`](static/banners).

## Adding an Artist

* Add the artists' details to [`_data/artists.yml`](_data/artists.yml) (look for `example:`).
* Add an avatar pic to [`static/artists/%id%.jpg`](static/artists).

## Publish a preview

This will be a triggerable action in the future.

## Publish to `bass-on.nz`

This will be a triggerable action in the future.

Here are some general guidelines we have for our events.

* **Bring good vibes only.**

* **Bring your own drinks.** \
  No glass please. (One of our cars got fucked because of that. \
  We don't want that happening to someone's foot.)

* **Remember water and appropiate clothes.** \
  It gets cold at night, especially during winter.

* **Let's keep Secret Locations secret.** \
  Please keep the locations to yourselves and don't geotag your Snaps as you post them. The longer the location says secret, the better time we'll have.

* **Avoid parking at our events.** \
  We discourage parking at our events. <span title="If we find you're not good to drive. We'll arrange alternative transport options with you.">It's a DUI risk</span> and it increases our chances of being found out. Please Uber in or use our shuttles if we run them.

* **Look after your own trash.** \
  We'll have rubbish bags, but we also kinda hate cleaning up after running the mosh.

* **Need help?** \
  Feel free to call out to some of the DJs not currently playing or the big fella in a reflective vest.

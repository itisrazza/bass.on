* Bring good vibes only. \

* Bring your own drinks. \
  No glass please. (One of the DJs fucked up his tires because of that.) \

* Remember water and warm clothes. \

* Try not parking at our events. \
  It can get us shut down, and we'll be **BASS:OFF**. \
  (Plus, you probably don't want a DUI.) \

* Look after your own trash. \
  We'll have rubbish bags, but we kinda hate cleaning up after. \
